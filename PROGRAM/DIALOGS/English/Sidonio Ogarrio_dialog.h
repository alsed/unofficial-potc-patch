"Who's asking?!",
"A friend of Mr. Wilfred Bythesea... I've come to settle your dispute with him.",

"We'll see about that! On guard!!",
"Mmm... Speak.",
"I offer you 10.000 to take care of Wilfred Bythesea. 5.000 now and 5.000 upon your return with the task done.",
"Interesting... do we have a deal then?",
"Ha-ha-ha Idiot! You think you're the first one to come and try to kill me? Bodyguards!! Get rid of him!",
