1.02r from September 24, 2003.
For the patch to work correctly you need to start a new game.
1. Fixed bug with respawning of player's boarding officers.
2. Fixed bug of inability to board multiple ships from time to time.
3. Fixed bug with Always Run option.
4. Reduced damage to ships during boarding.
5. Fixed a bug with the shipyard in Conceicao.
6. Fixed the bug of Camilo Machado's unwillingness to give the third mission (in the new storyline).
7. By popular demand: now, as in reality - the larger the caliber of the cannon, the further it shoots.
8. Fixed various bugs during boarding. 
9. Returned the ability to surrender to the enemy crew and the enemy captain.
10. Enemy ships now take the player on boarding based on their own skills and perks.
11. Returned the ability for ships to lose masts.
12. Returned the "Musket volley" perk. It works automatically when you start boarding.
13. You can now see the date and time of the save.
14. Reduced the rotation of the ship caught in a storm.
15. The weather has been diversified. Now the player will have access not only to doldrums and storms, but also to intermediate states.

17. Reduced font in interfaces.
18. In the "Ship" menu shows the class of the ship and the number of hitpoints of the hull in the format: current/maximum.
19. Officers can now be ordered to go with you on boarding (by default, no officers will board with you).
20. At the beginning of the game, the bosun offers the player two schemes of payment of the player's team - the usual, and percentage (from the profit for the last month). 
    If the payment is less than 100 gold, the crew's morale slowly decreases, and if the payment is more than 250*number of people, it climbs up.
    The initial rate is 20% of the last month's profits. The percentage is affected by the "Commerce" and "Leadership" skills.
    With fully pumped commerce and leadership, the rate is 2%.
    Profit is any money received by the player.
    The following are deducted from the total pool: ship repair, purchase of goods, return of money to a loan shark.
    The following are NOT deducted from the total pool: buying a ship (the crew finds it easier to capture them than to spend money), buying personal items, hiring officers.
    The amount paid out doesn't depend on the number of the crew.
21. Increased power of 32 pound guns (stand on forts and several quest ships)
22. Reduced the modifier that increases the hitpoints of enemies (previously hits could be more than 5 times the player, now is times).
23. In realistic mode, increased difficulty on land combat- The enemies now use more often block and pistols.
24. Strengthened all guards in cities without exception. Now their sword skills will be adjusted depending on the player's sword skills.
25. Sale of ships has become less profitable.
26. Added the shotgun. Can be found at the very end of the main quest. Killing characters with this weapon does not gain experience or ears. After taking the item, when you press ENTER, you will see a menu to switch mode.
27. Now, if the enemy ship decides to leave the battlefield, it will shoot knippels, seeking to knock down the sails of pursuing ships.
28. Reduced the weight of some types of goods, which should lead to a more balanced trade.
29. Fixed a bug with officers.


1.02b2 dated September 4, 2003.
NOTES. Patch version 1.02b2 is a beta version. The final version will be released in the next two weeks.

11. Fixed a bug in the main storyline, when the player in search of Ferro Cerezo sailed immediately to Conceicao, and, although the driver said that Cerezo was there, he wasn't, and only appeared  after a few days.
12. Added a major new storyline, woven into the main storyline.
        a) In the third mission of this storyline you can switch sides to the pirates, and join the brotherhood of the coast (progression through the pirate storyline depends on whether you have completed the main storyline before taking the quest).
        b) Read the dialogues carefully :-)
        c) Complete non-linearity (but it is recommended to think in order to find ways to succeed).
        d) A careless attitude to the given task can easily lead to be asked to leave by the employer.
        e) An opportunity to take over a new quest ship -the Fearless- a battleship with improved characteristics and unique geometry.

        h) The opportunity to capture the Barracuda, a frigate slightly weaker than Mephisto.
13. Fixed bug with player and nation reconciliation. Now forts also make peace with the player.

29. Added perk "Anchor Colector" - after taking this perk, when sinking a ship an anchor will be added (I don't know where the player keeps them) and, consequently, in the interface youy can see the number of sunken ships.
30. Fixed a bug where the player could be attacked by pirates, when entering the pirate's den in Douweseen.
31. When hiring an officer, don't forget to talk to him to set whether or not he will go on the boarding party with you. In this regard - the boarding party can now be kept just as passengers - it will still appear on the boarded ship. But keep in mind - the more officers go with you, the more enemies on deck.
32. The number of crew on the ship now affects the synchronization of firing cannons (at skill level 10 and a full team, the salvo from all cannons occurs almost simultaneously, but if the team is not full there are delays between shots).
33. With the keys "+" and "-" you can change the speed of time (available acceleration from 0.0 (pause) to 10.0).
34. Bug at the end of the main quest has been fixed, which appeared when player saved the game when entering the labyrinth, but when loading the save all of his officers disappeared. (This caused an inability to finish the game, because an important story conversation did not started).
