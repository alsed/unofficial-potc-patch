# unofficial-potc-patch
This is a translation and reconstruction of the official patch 1.03 for Akella's 2003 videogame Pirates of the Caribbean.

-For now- it only works for the EURO (English) version of the game.

Some comments about it's reconstruction:

- The patch raised the difficulty to a game that already had, in its final part, a significant escalation of it. I have tried to moderate this, balancing the combat during boarding, and also in the naval attacks on the forts.
- Reviewing the code it can be noticed that the 'surrender mod' was introduced to the game, originally made by StoneD. This is so, because certain comments by the author remain in the code. I have restored the missing comments and fixed some bugs.
- There is code from other modifications present, such as AlexusB's sea encounter screen. I have also introduced fixes, in order to make it work properly.
- I have also made some modifications that were not present in the original patch. Based on that some NPCs gave weapons to the character when defeated -and also Nathan Kell's mod-, I have added a 10% chance that the character will receive a weapon when defeating an enemy. This adds more variety to the gameplay, as it allows the players to see several swords during their gameplay.
- Although the patch makes several fixes, it does not resolve all of them. There are still questlog entries that repeat, events that don't happen, and other problems that are pending final fixes.
- I have tried to keep the patch as close as possible to the original version, making only the necessary corrections. The result, I hope, is a more polished game with a simple gameplay, as was with the original version, more than 20 years ago.
